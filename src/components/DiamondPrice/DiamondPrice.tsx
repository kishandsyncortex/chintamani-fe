            Understanding diamond prices is a bit complex for newbies. Diamonds
            are valued on a per carat basis. Carat is a standard measurement
            unit for weight. Just, as kilograms or ounces for gold, the term
            “carat” is used with diamonds. 1-carat diamond weight equal to 200
            milligrams. Check the below link to know more about diamond carat or
            ignore & read further if you already know.

            I believe you have read the above article, as it’s important to know
            first about diamond carat and then about diamond pricing.

            How is Diamond Value Calculated in Trade?

          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">
            Diamonds price is always calculated on a per carat basis, whether
            you buy 0.32 carat, 1.27 CT, or 3.04-carat diamond. Let do some math
            to make it easy. For example,
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">
            Formula: Diamond Cost = Carat Weight * Price Per Carat
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">

            per carat,{" "}
            <span className="underline decoration-1">1.27 carat is 1800$</span>{" "}
            per carat & price for 3.04 carat is 4100$ per carat which means :
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">
            A ) 0.32 * 850 = 272$ Total for 0.32 ct{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">
            B) 1.27 * 1800 = 2286$ Total for 1.27 ct{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">
            C ) 3.04 * 4100 = 12464$ Total for 3.04 ct
          </p>
          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">
            But all the major online diamond vendors display the total price, so
            you don’t have to do math all the time. If you buying a diamond from
            diamond manufacturers, prices are quoted per carat basis. So, make
            sure with a salesperson before taking any further decision.

            Most of you might be wondering, from where do these price per carat

            price per carat from 0.01 to 10.00ct for D-to-N color and FL-to-I2
            clarity. However, the RAPAPORT diamond price list (RAP List) is most

            need to know 3 things. Weight, Color, &{" "}

            As you can see on the above price list image there are different
            values for every diamond. Here we have 4 different carat weight
            segments which further can be read in a matrix. So, For 1.01 carat,
            we have to look at the 1.00-1.49 ct price segment. Then, check color
            & clarity verticality and horizontally within the matrix.

            All the values are in hundreds. So the price for 1.01 H VS2 is 6300
            USD per carat. This is an old price list just used for reference and
            example.{" "}

            Pricing simply does not rely on the diamond’s color, clarity, and
            carat. There are a lot of other factors that determine a diamond’s
            value. Like, you can even buy GIA 0.50 ct I SI1 at 45% discount
            (cheapest) or another similar stone at 35% discount (expensive)

          <p className="leading-[1.6] font-poppins text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#404040] ">
            Factors like diamond fluorescence, diamond cut, symmetry, polish,
            etc affect most. Another major factor that affects the diamond price
            is its “CLARITY”. A VS2 diamond with center black crystal will be
            cheaper and a VS2 diamond with eye-clean will cost more. Let see the
            below example screenshot from James Allen. How price changes despite
            all other things ( fluorescence, cut, polish, symmetry) remain the
            same. It’s due to NICE VS2 and BAD VS2 in simple words.
