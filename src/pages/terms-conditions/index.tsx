                        The price of the goods is, in general, the price displayed on the Website at the time of the order. Although we try to ensure that all prices on the Website are correct, the rates are detected live from the Global Exchange (real time), though errors may occur. We review the prices as part of the order confirmation. If the correct price of your goods is below our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when shipping the goods. IF A PRODUCT'S CORRECT PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE STATED ON THE WEBSITE, WE WILL EITHER CONTACT YOU FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE DISPATCHING THE PRODUCT(S) OR REJECT YOUR ORDER AND NOTIFY YOU OF SUCH REJECTION. Once we have contacted you and informed you that the price is higher than the price stated on the Website, you can cancel your order free of charge. You will then receive a full refund. If an order is canceled this way, you agree that this releases us from any service obligations except the obligation to repay.
